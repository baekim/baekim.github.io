- None of the options are correct.
- <span style='color: red'>All of the options are correct.</span>

<br/>📌 Which of the following represent the two important characteristics of the data science methodology?

- It immediately ends when the model is deployed because no feedback is required.
- It is a highly iterative process and immediately ends when the model is deployed.

- <span style='color: red'>It is a highly iterative process and it never ends.</span>

<br/>📌 Data scientists may use either a “top-down” approach or a “bottom-up” approach to data science. These two approaches refer to:

- "Top-down” approach – models are fit before the data is explored. "Bottom-up” approach – data is explored, and then a model is fit.
- “Top-down” approach – using massively parallel, warehouses with huge data volumes as the data source. “Bottom-up” approach – using a sample of small data before using large data.
- <span style='color: red'>“Top-down” approach – first defining a business problem then analyzing the data to find a solution. “Bottom-up” approach – starting with the data, and then coming up with a business problem based on the data.</span>
- “Top-down” approach – the data, when sorted, is modeled from the “top” of the data towards the “bottom”. “Bottom-up” approach – the data is modeled from the “bottom” of the data to the “top”.
